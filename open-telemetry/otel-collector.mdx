sidebarTitle: OTel Collector Contrib
---

The following document describes how to natively configure the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution with the Middleware platform. Use the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect, process, and export your telemetry data that is not accessable through the core OpenTelemetry Project.

<Note> The Kubernetes OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution is not available and in development. </Note>

# Linux Installation

<Accordion title="Step 1: Install DEB or RPM">

    [Download](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation/#linux) the `opentelemetry-collector` with the same package manager you used to install the MW Agent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Use otelcol-contrib">
    Use the `otelcol-contrib (opentelemetry-collector-contrib)` distribution instead of the `otelcol (opentelemetry-collector)` for the OpenTelemetry Collector.

    When prompted to download `otelcol`, download one of the following instead:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```powershell DEB
    # AMD64
    otelcol-contrib_0.92.0_linux_amd64.deb
    # ARM64
    otelcol-contrib_0.92.0_linux_arm64.deb
    ```

    ```powershell RPM
    # AMD64
    otelcol-contrib_0.92.0_linux_amd64.rpm 
    # ARM64
    otelcol-contrib_0.92.0_linux_arm64.rpm
    ```

    </CodeGroup>  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Follow OTel Config">
    Once you have installed Linux, proceed to the [Configuration Section](/open-telemetry/otel-collector#configuration).
</Accordion>

# Docker Installation

<Accordion title="Step 1: Install DockerHub or ghcr.io">
    [Download](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation/) the opentelemetry-collector with the same container registry you used to install the MW Agent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Use otelcol-contrib">
    Ensure the container image refers to the `opentelemetry-collector-contrib` and not core `opentelemetry-collector`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Follow OTel Config">
    Once you have installed Docker, proceed to the [Configuration Section](/open-telemetry/otel-collector#configuration).
</Accordion>

# Configuration

<Accordion title="Step 1: Configure Collector">
    Follow the [OTel Configuration Instructions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/) to configure the `opentelemetry-collector-contrib`

    <Note> You must fully configure the OTel Collector before adding more code to the `processors`, `exporters` and `service` section. </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Add to Processors">

    Add the following code to the `processors` section:

    ```YAML YAML
    processors:
      resourcedetection:
        detectors: [ env, system ]
        timeout: 2s
        system:
          hostname_sources: [ os ]
      resource/middleware:
        attributes:
        - action: upsert
          key: mw.account_key
          value: <your-mw-api-key>
        - action: upsert
          from_attribute: host.name
          key: host.id
    ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Add to Exporters">

    Add the following code to the `exporters` section:

    ```YAML YAML
    exporters:
      otlp/middleware:
        endpoint: "your-endpoint.middleware.io:443"
        headers:
          authorization: "<your-mw-api-key>"
        sending_queue:
          enabled: true
          num_consumers: 100
          queue_size: 10000
    ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4: Add to Service">
    Add the following code within the pipelines section:

    ```YAML YAML
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [ <your-receivers-list-for-traces> ]
          processors: [ resourcedetection, resource/middleware, 
                        <your-processor-list-for-traces> ]
          exporters: [ otlp/middleware, <your-exporters-list-for-traces> ]
        metrics:
          receivers: [ <your-receivers-list-for-metrics> ]
          processors: [ resourcedetection, resource/middleware ]
          exporters: [ otlp/middleware, <your-exporters-list-for-metrics> ]
        logs:
          receivers: [ <your-receivers-list-for-logs> ]
          processors: [ resourcedetection, resource/middleware, 
                        <your-processors-list-for-logs> ]
          exporters: [otlp/middleware, <your-exporters-list-for-logs>]
    ```
</Accordion>

# Limitations

Metrics such as bandwidth and disk speed are not currently collected by the OpenTelemetry Collector and will contain `0` in those fields. This will impact the Infrastructure page as well as any custom dashboard containing these metrics.
