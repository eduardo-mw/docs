The Integrations section provides teams a more robust Middleware experience by connecting users to their favorite third-party applications. Middleware currently offers four different types of integrations: Collaboration, Cloud, Databases, and Telemetry. Each integration offers unique benefits to help you optimize your team's workflows and extend the capabilities of your Middleware account.

**Collaboration**: Enhance team productivity by integrating with popular tools such as Jira, Slack, PagerDuty, and Opsgenie. Streamline communication and incident management to keep your teams well-connected and informed.

**Cloud**: Seamlessly connect to cloud services like AWS CloudWatch to gain insights into your cloud infrastructure. Monitor, analyze, and optimize cloud resources with ease.

**Databases**: Integrate with databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL to manage and monitor database performance efficiently. Ensure data integrity and streamline database operations.
