title: Infrastructure Monitoring
---

This guide provides an overview of Middlewareâ€™s Infrastructure Monitoring page. Collect, configure, and visualize complex telemetry across your Infrastructures with our autodetection capabilities.

The Middleware Host Agent auto collects data across the stack using the OTel framework. While collecting, the Agent will also compress and batch data to your account to allow near real time analysis on all data points regarding your clusters, nodes, pods and services.

Middleware supports Infra Monitoring on many distributions, all can be found [here](/agent-installation/overview)."

# Key Concepts

### Host List

The Host List is the highest level compoenent overview, providing a top-down approach for diagnosing, monitoring, and maintaining your stack. It provides insights into your orchestration data, database usage, system-wide infrastructure utilization and general health of your stack.

### Containers

Containers provide visibility into the health and performance of your containerized environments. Middleware collects Container data based on the VMs running in your infra. This does not include containers managed by Kubernetes.

### Processes

Processes are system level methods being run or managed inside of your hosts. This data is pulled directly from the kernel of each host and imported to Middleware through the Host Agent. You may use this data to analyze process health, overall process impact on your infrastructure, and drill into each process to uncover further data points.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, management, and operation of containerized applications. Effortlessly personalize your k8s data visualization experience.

<Accordion title="Clusters">
  A cluster is a collection of nodes that operate together as a single unit. These include control plane components and nodes that run the actual workloads.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Nodes">
    A node is a physical or virtual machine within a Kubernetes cluster where containers are deployed and run.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Services">
    A service defines a particular set of pods and provides a consistent network endpoint to access them. A service can be used for load balancing, service discovery, and a layer of abstraction for connecting to applications within a cluster.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workloads">
    A workload is a tool for managing the configuration and scale of your application components within a Kubernetes cluster.

    <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="Pods">
            Pods are the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. They represent one or more containers that share the same network namespace, storage, and IP address. Pods are scheduled onto nodes.

        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Containers">
            Containers are the fundamental units running with pods, which are scheduled onto nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Deployments">
            Deployments provide declarative updates to applications. They are a high-level abstraction that simplifies the management and scaling of applications.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="ReplicaSets">
            ReplicaSets ensure a specified number of replica pods are running at any given time. ReplicaSets can be used for horizontally scaling your applications. 
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Jobs">
            Jobs are controller objects that represent finite and short-lived tasks or batch processes that run within pods.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="CronJobs">
            CronJobs are controller objects that can be scheduled to automate task execution. CronJobs are Jobs that can be run on a periodic schedule.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="DaemonSet">
            DaemonSets are controllers that ensure a specific set of pods is running across your cluster. DaemonSets are used to run exactly one instance of a pod on each node in the cluster.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="StatefulSet">
            StatefulSets are used for managing stateful applications that are comprised of unique network identifiers, persistent storage, and specific ordering requirements for their deployment and scaling. 
        </Accordion>

        </AccordionGroup>

</Accordion>
