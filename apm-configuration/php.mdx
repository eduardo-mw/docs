This guide walks you through setting up Application Performance Monitoring (APM) on a PHP application. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in your Middleware Account. View example code <a href="https://github.com/middleware-labs/demo-apm/tree/master/php"> here. </a>

# Prerequisites

<Steps>

  <Step title="MW Host Agent">
   Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent). To install the MW Agent, see our <a href="https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/overview"> installation guide</a>. 
  
  </Step>

  <Step title="PHP Version">
    `PHP version 8` or above. Check your PHP version with the following command.
    ```shell Shell
    php -v
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Install

<Accordion title="Step 1: Install PHP Extensions">

  <Accordion title="Step 1a: Install Pecl & Composer">
    - [Pecl](https://pecl.php.net/) Installation
    - [Composer Installation](https://getcomposer.org/)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 1b: Install otel-instrumentation">

    Install the extension:
    ```bash Shell
    sudo pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/opentelemetry-1.0.0beta3
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 1c: Add Extension to php.ini">

    Add the extension to your `php.ini` file:

    ```php php
    [opentelemetry]
    extension=opentelemetry.so
    ```

    The `php.ini` file can be found using the following commands based on your Linux distribution:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo nano /etc/php/<php_version>/cli/php.ini
    ```

    ```bash CentOS/RHEL
    sudo nano /etc/php.ini
    ```

    ```bash Arch Linux
    sudo nano /etc/php/php.ini
    ```

    ```bash Web-Serve
    sudo nano /etc/php/<php_version>/apache2/php.ini
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 1d: Verify Installation">

    Verify the extension is installed and enabled.
    ```bash Shell
    php -m | grep opentelemetry
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Troubleshooting">        
      Below we cover a few common errors and their solutions. 

      If you receive a pecl: command not found error, run the following command.
      ```bash Shell
      sudo apt-get update
      apt-get install php-pear php8.1-dev
      ```
      If you receive any broken dependency issues, including errors like libpcre2-dev : Depends: libpcre2-8-0 / libpcre2-16-0 / libpcre2-32-0, run the following command.
      ```bash Shell
      sudo apt --fix-broken install
      ```
      If you receive an ERROR: ‘phpize’ failed error, run the following commands.
      ```bash Shell
      sudo apt-get update 
      sudo apt-get install php8.1-dev

      sudo apt-get update
      sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
      ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Step 2: Install APM-PHP Package"> 

Ensure you have a PHP project set up and a `composer.json` file in your project’s root directory. If you do not have one, create it using composer init. Then run the following to install Middleware’s APM-PHP package.
```bash Shell
composer update
composer require middleware/agent-apm-php
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Import Tracker"> 
Add these lines to the beginning of your project. 
```php PHP
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Middleware\AgentApmPhp\MwTracker;
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4: Container Variables"> 
  <Accordion title="Docker Containers">
    Applications running in a container require an additional environment variable. If your application is not running in a container, move to Step 6. 

    For Docker containers, add the following environment variable to your application.
    ```bash Shell
    MW_AGENT_SERVICE=<DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY_ADDRESS>
    ```
    <Note> docker bridge gateway address is the IP address of the gateway between the Docker host and the bridge network, which is 172.17.0.1 by default. 
    Refer more about Docker bridge networking [here](https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-standalone/) </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Kubernetes Containers">
    ```bash Shell
    kubectl get service --all-namespaces | grep mw-service
    ```

    Then add the following environment variable to your application deployment YAML file. 
    ```bash Shell
    MW_AGENT_SERVICE=mw-service.mw-agent-ns.svc.cluster.local
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 5: Implement APM Collector"> 
Start a tracing scope at the beginning of your code. 

```php PHP
$tracker = new MwTracker('<PROJECT-NAME>', '<SERVICE-NAME>');
$tracker->preTrack();
```

Define hooks with class and function names beneath the tracing scope.
```php Shell
$tracker->registerHook('<CLASS-NAME-1>', '<FUNCTION-NAME-1>', [
    'custom.attr1' => 'value1',
    'custom.attr2' => 'value2',
]);
$tracker->registerHook('<CLASS-NAME-2>', '<FUNCTION-NAME-2>');
```

End the tracing scope after your code. 
```php PHP
$tracker->postTrack();
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 6: Enable Logging"> 
To ingest custom logs, utilize the following functions based on desired log severity levels.
 ```php PHP
   $tracker->warn("this is warning log.");
   $tracker->error("this is error log.");
   $tracker->info("this is info log.");
   $tracker->debug("this is debug log.");
```
</Accordion>

# Continuous Profiling

Continuous profiling captures real-time performance insights from your application to enable rapid identification of resource allocation, bottlenecks, and more. 

Continuous Profiling for the Cloudflare APM is not yet available; reach out to our support team if you'd like more information. Navigate to the [Continuous Profiling](https://docs.middleware.io/workflow/profiling#continuous-profiling) section to learn more about using Continuous Profiling with our other APMs.
