This guide walks you through setting up Application Performance Monitoring (APM) on a PHP application. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in your Middleware Account. View example code <a href="https://github.com/middleware-labs/demo-apm/tree/master/php"> here. </a>

# Prerequisites

<Steps>

  <Step title="MW Host Agent">
   The Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent). To install the MW Agent please see our <a href="https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/overview"> installation guides </a>. 
  
  </Step>

  <Step title="PHP Version">
    `PHP version 8` or above. Check your PHP version with the following command.
    ```shell Shell
    php -v
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="PHP Extensions">
    <a href="https://pecl.php.net/"> Pecl </a> and <a href="https://getcomposer.org/"> Composer </a> and the otel-instrumentation PHP extension (see below)


<Accordion title="PHP Extension">

Follow these steps to install the required otel-instrumentation PHP extension. 

Install the extension.
```bash Shell
sudo pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/opentelemetry-1.0.0beta3
```
Mention the extension as extension=opentelemetry.so in your php.ini file. The php.ini file can be found using the following commands based on your Linux distribution.

Ubuntu/Debian
```bash Shell
sudo nano /etc/php/<php_version>/cli/php.ini
```
CentOS/RHEL
```bash Shell
sudo nano /etc/php.ini
```
Arch Linux
```bash Shell
sudo nano /etc/php/php.ini
```
Specific to Web-Serve
```bash Shell
sudo nano /etc/php/<php_version>/apache2/php.ini
```
Verify the extension is installed and enabled.
```bash Shell
php -m | grep opentelemetry
```
    <Accordion title="Troubleshooting">        
        Below we cover a few common errors and their solutions. 

        If you receive a pecl: command not found error, run the following command.
        ```bash Shell
        sudo apt-get update
        apt-get install php-pear php8.1-dev
        ```
        If you receive any broken dependency issues, including errors like libpcre2-dev : Depends: libpcre2-8-0 / libpcre2-16-0 / libpcre2-32-0, run the following command.
        ```bash Shell
        sudo apt --fix-broken install
        ```
        If you receive an ERROR: ‘phpize’ failed error, run the following commands.
        ```bash Shell
        sudo apt-get update 
        sudo apt-get install php8.1-dev

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
        ```
    </Accordion>

  </Step>

</Steps>

# Install

<Accordion title="Step 1: Install APM-PHP Package"> 

Ensure you have a PHP project set up and a composer.json file in your project’s root directory. If you do not have one, create it using composer init. Then run the following to install Middleware’s APM-PHP package.
```bash Shell
composer update
composer require middleware/agent-apm-php
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Import Tracker"> 
Add these lines to the beginning of your project. 
```php PHP
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Middleware\AgentApmPhp\MwTracker;
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Container Variables"> 
Applications running in a container require an additional environment variable. If your application is not running in a container, move to Step 5. 

For Docker containers, add the following environment variable to your application.
```bash Shell
MW_AGENT_SERVICE=<DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY_ADDRESS>
```
<Note> docker bridge gateway address is the IP address of the gateway between the Docker host and the bridge network, which is 172.17.0.1 by default. 
Refer more about Docker bridge networking [here](https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-standalone/) </Note>

```bash Shell
kubectl get service --all-namespaces | grep mw-service
```

Then add the following environment variable to your application deployment YAML file. 
```bash Shell
MW_AGENT_SERVICE=mw-service.mw-agent-ns.svc.cluster.local
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4: Implement APM Collector"> 
Start a tracing scope at the beginning of your code. 

```php PHP
$tracker = new MwTracker('<PROJECT-NAME>', '<SERVICE-NAME>');
$tracker->preTrack();
```

Define hooks with class and function names beneath the tracing scope.
```php Shell
$tracker->registerHook('<CLASS-NAME-1>', '<FUNCTION-NAME-1>', [
    'custom.attr1' => 'value1',
    'custom.attr2' => 'value2',
]);
$tracker->registerHook('<CLASS-NAME-2>', '<FUNCTION-NAME-2>');
```

End the tracing scope after your code. 
```php PHP
$tracker->postTrack();
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 5: Enable Logging"> 
To ingest custom logs, utilize the following functions based on desired log severity levels.
 ```php PHP
   $tracker->warn("this is warning log.");
   $tracker->error("this is error log.");
   $tracker->info("this is info log.");
   $tracker->debug("this is debug log.");
```
</Accordion>

# Continuous Profiling

Continuous profiling captures real-time performance insights from your application to enable rapid identification of resource allocation, bottlenecks, and more. The following table describes the available features offered by the continuous profiler for the PHP APM.

Continuous Profiling for the PHP APM is not yet available; reach out to our support team if you'd like more information. To learn more about Continuous Profiling, see examples in our [Workflows](/workflow/profiling) section.
