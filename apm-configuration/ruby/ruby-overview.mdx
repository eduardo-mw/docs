## Supported Ruby Versions

The Ruby APM should work well with Ruby 3.0.2+ applications.
You can check this with ...

```bash
ruby --version
```

## Current Technical Approach

Our Ruby APM works based on [Opentelemetry Ruby](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby)

We have published the [Gem Package](https://rubygems.org/gems/middleware_apm) to be used in ruby application

- Support the traces anf
- Supports the profiling based on pyroscope
- Set up data export rules, so that telemetry data can be forwarded to our Host Agent

## Releases

For ruby gem feature updates, You can refer [RubyGem](https://rubygems.org/gems/middleware_apm) release list and for code over [here](https://github.com/middleware-labs/ruby-gem/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## Feature list

## Roadmap

- We are planning to add the suport the unavailable features in [feature list](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/apm-configuration/ruby/ruby-overview#feature-list).
- We are planning to support Hostless APM as well which can send data directly to Middleware without need of any host agent. This will help to monitor cloud based managed applications.
