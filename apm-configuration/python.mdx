This guide walks you through setting up Application Performance Monitoring (APM) on a Python application. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in your Middleware Account. View example code <a href="https://github.com/middleware-labs/demo-apm/tree/master/python"> here </a>.


## Prerequisites

* Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent), to install the MW Agent please see our <a href="https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/overview"> installation guide. </a> 
* Python 3, version 3.8 or above recommended. Check your Python version with the following command.
```bash Shell
python3 --version
```
* pip version 23.1.2

## Step 1: Install Middleware Python APM Package
Run the following command in your terminal.
```python Shell
pip install middleware-apm
```

Then run the following to confirm, and as needed install, instrumentation libraries for the included packages.
```python Shell
middleware-bootstrap -a install
```

## Step 2: Import Tracker
Add the following lines to the beginning of your application code base. The access token is your account key, which can be found on the Installation page.

```python Python 3
from mw_tracker import MwTracker
tracker=MwTracker(
    access_token="{YOUR-ACCESS_TOKEN}"
)
```

## Step 3: Container Variables
Applications running in a container require an additional environment variable. If your application is not running in a container, move to Step 4. 

For Docker containers, add the following environment variable to your application.
```bash Shell
MW_AGENT_SERVICE=<DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY_ADDRESS>
```
<Note> docker bridge gateway address is the IP address of the gateway between the Docker host and the bridge network, which is 172.17.0.1 by default. 
Refer more about Docker bridge networking [here](https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-standalone/) </Note>

```bash Shell
kubectl get service --all-namespaces | grep mw-service
```

Then add the following environment variable to your application deployment YAML file. 
```bash Shell
MW_AGENT_SERVICE=mw-service.mw-agent-ns.svc.cluster.local
```

## Step 4: Capture Application Data

### Traces
Distributed tracing will be automatically enabled upon completing Step 4: Run Application. 

### Metrics
Enable metrics by writing the following line just after the tracker initialization from Step 2.
```python Python 3
tracker.collect_metrics()
```

### Application & Custom Logs
Enable application logs by writing the following line after the tracker initialization from Step 2. 
```python Python 3
tracker.collect_logs()
```
To ingest custom logs, utilize the following functions based on desired log severity levels.
```python Python 3
logging.info(“<info sample>”)
logging.warn(“<warn sample>”)
logging.error(“<error sample>”)
```

### Profiling
Enable profiling by writing the following line after the tracker initialization from Step 2.
```python Python 3
tracker.collect_profiling()
```

### Stack Traces
Use the tracker.record_error(e) method to record a stack trace when an error occurs. See an example of this method below. 
```python Python 3
randomList = ['a', 0, 2]

for entry in randomList:
    try:
         r = 1/int(entry)
         break
    except Exception as e:
         tracker.record_error(e)
```

## Step 5: Run Application
Run your application with the command given below.
```python Shell
middleware-instrument \
--exporter_otlp_endpoint http://localhost:9319 \
--resource_attributes=project.name=<project_name>,mw.app.lang=python,runtime.metrics.python=true \
--service_name <service_name> \
python3 <app>.py
```
