This guide walks you through setting up Application Performance Monitoring (APM) on a Python application. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in your Middleware Account. View example code [here](https://github.com/middleware-labs/demo-apm/tree/master/python).


# Prerequisites

<Steps>

  <Step title="MW Host Agent">
   Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent). To install the MW Agent, see our [Installation Guide](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/overview). 
  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Python Version">
   `Python 3 version 3.8` or above. Check your Python version with the following command:
    ```bash Shell
    python3 --version
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pip Version">
    `pip version 23.1.2` or above. Check your pip version with the following command:
    ```bash Shell
    pip --version
    ```  
  </Step>

</Steps>



# Install

<Accordion title="Step 1: Install Middleware Python APM Package"> 
Run the following command in your terminal:
```python Shell
pip install middleware-apm
```

Check if the `middleware-apm` has been installed with the following command:
```python Shell
pip list
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Import Middleware Tracker"> 

Add the following lines to the beginning of your application:

```python Python 3
import logging 
 
from middleware import MwTracker
tracker=MwTracker()
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Container Variables (Optional)"> 
Applications running in a container require an additional environment variable. If your application is not running in a container, move to Step 4. 


Add the following environment variable to your application:
```bash Shell
MW_AGENT_SERVICE=<DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY_ADDRESS>
```

Add the following command to your `Dockerfile` after the `pip install` command:
```Dockerfile Dockerfile
RUN middleware-bootstrap -a install
```

<Note> docker bridge gateway address is the IP address of the gateway between the Docker host and the bridge network, which is 172.17.0.1 by default. 
Refer more about Docker bridge networking [here](https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-standalone/) </Note>

For Kubernetes, first identify the namespace where the MW Agent is running:

```bash Shell
kubectl get service --all-namespaces | grep mw-service
```

Then add the following environment variable to your application deployment YAML file:
```bash Shell
MW_AGENT_SERVICE=mw-service.mw-agent-ns.svc.cluster.local
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4: Capture Application Data"> 
    <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="Step 4a: Setup .ini File"> 

            Create a `.ini` file based on the features you want to observe. `service_name` and `access_token` are required for the tracker to send data to Middleware.

            ```python .ini
            [middleware.common]

            # The name of your application as service-name, as it will appear in the UI to filter out your data.
            service_name = {APM-SERVICE-NAME}

            # This Token binds the Python Agent's data and profiling data to your account.
            access_token = {YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN}

            # The service name, where Middleware Agent is running, in case of K8s.
            mw_agent_service = mw-service.mw-agent-ns.svc.cluster.local

            # Distributed traces for your application (false = disabled).
            collect_traces = true

            # Collection of metrics for your application (false = disabled).
            collect_metrics = true

            # Collection of logs for your application (false = disabled).
            collect_logs = true

            # Collection of profiling data for your application (false = disabled).
            collect_profiling = true
            ```
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Step 4b: Enable Custom Logs"> 

            To ingest custom logs, utilize the following functions based on desired log severity levels:

            ```python Python 3
            logging.info("info sample")
            logging.warning("Sample Warning Log") 
            logging.error("Sample Error Log.", extra={'tester': 'Alex'})
            ```
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Step 4c: Stack Errors"> 
            
            Use `tracker.record_error()` method to record a stack trace when an error occurs:

            ```python Python 3
            try:
                not_possible = 12/0
            except ZeroDivisionError as e:
                tracker.record_error(e)
            ```
        </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 6: Start Your Project">

After deploying your application, run the following command to start your project:
```shell Shell
MIDDLEWARE_CONFIG_FILE=./middleware.ini middleware-apm run python app.py
```
</Accordion>

# Continuous Profiling

Continuous profiling captures real-time performance insights from your application to enable rapid identification of resource allocation, bottlenecks, and more. Navigate to the [Continuous Profiling](https://docs.middleware.io/workflow/profiling#continuous-profiling) section to learn more about using Continuous Profiling with the Python APM.
