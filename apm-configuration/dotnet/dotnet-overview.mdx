## Supported .NET Version

The .NET APM should work well with .NET 7+ applications.
You can check this with ...

```bash
dotnet --version
```

## Current Technical Approach

Our .NET APM works on custom [.NET plugin](https://github.com/middleware-labs/dotnet-plugin) based on [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation)

We have customized this base package based on our product requirement.

- Added the support of metrics, traces, and custom logger.
- Set up data export rules, so that telemetry data can be forwarded to our Host Agent

## Releases

For .NET plugin feature updates, You can refer release list over [here](https://github.com/middleware-labs/dotnet-plugin/releases).

## Feature list

| Feature          | Status              |

## Roadmap

- We are planning to add the suport the unavailable features in [feature list](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/apm-configuration/dotnet/dotnet-overview#feature-list).
- We are planning to support Hostless APM as well which can send data directly to Middleware without need of any host agent.
  This will help to monitor cloud based managed applications.
