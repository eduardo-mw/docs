This guide provides an overview of Middleware Application Performance Monitoring and instructions for its configuration on applications using [Node.js](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/apm-configuration/node-js), [Go](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/apm-configuration/go), [Python](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/apm-configuration/python), [Java](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/apm-configuration/java), [PHP](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/apm-configuration/php), [.NET](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/apm-configuration/dotnet), [Cloudflare](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/apm-configuration/cloudflare), or [Next.js](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/apm-configuration/next-js). 



Middleware Application Performance Monitoring (APM) provides deep visibility into your applications by unifying application level logs, metrics, and traces with data and logs from the host agent in out-of-the-box dashboards and detailed drill-down views. 


Middleware APM does require our Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent) be installed on the applicationâ€™s host infrastructure, except for applications deployed with Cloudflare Worker. If you do not have the MW Agent installed please see our installation guides for [Kubernetes](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/kubernetes), [Linux](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/linux), or [Docker](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/agent-installation/docker). On Windows machines only Go, Node, Python, and Java are currently supported. 


To view or setup demos and example use cases please see our <a href="https://github.com/middleware-labs/demo-apm"> APM Demo Github repository </a>.
