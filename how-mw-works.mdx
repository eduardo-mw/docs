# How Middleware Works

### Infrastructure Agents & APM SDKs 

Middleware provides agent software to be installed on Linux, Docker, Kubernetes & Microsoft Windows. These agents can collect host metrics along with collecting signals from other integrations. Agents also act as a local endpoint to collect logs, metrics & traces from applications using Middleware language APM SDKs.

### OpenTelemetry

Middleware also provides SDKs for different languages which could be used to instrument applications to collect telemetry signals. These telemetry signals can then be sent to the Middleware backend either directly from the applications or through Middleware agents installed in your infrastructure.
