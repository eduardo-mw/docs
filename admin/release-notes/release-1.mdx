# Features

1. Option to clone existing dashboard 
2. With this feature, users can clone any dashboard and edit it , this is helpful when a user wants to create multiple dashboards with minor changes. 
3. Cassandra Integration with default dashboard 
4. Red Panda integration with default dashboard
5. RUM iOS SDK

# UI/UX
1. Grammar/Typo and naming conventions are changed now at some places inside infrastructure, RUM and synthetic monitoring.
2. Blank page issues on some reports are fixed. 
3. Updated filters for synthetic. 

# Backend

- Disabling the auto creation of reports after login. (this background process was loading when user logs) 
- Query update on log size counting. (earlier we were counting only log body size but now with the updated query, we are counting whole table size including columns which includes log attributes) - with this, we are expecting the log size to be increased. 


# Fixes

- RUM SDK - crash count wrong issue.
- UI issue inside RUM -> session -> attributes (bottom part visibility issue)
- Vulnerability - remove direct object reference from all the places inside the app.
- Infrastructure monitoring -> “live” button not working issue fixed. 
- Data loading for Nodes (inside infra -> kubernetes -> nodes )
- Fixed the issue of inconsistency in graph data when modifying the date-time for container list and host list inside infrastructure monitoring.
- Fixed the issue of graphs not updating as per selected time range for host listing. 

# Other Improvements

1. Date and time range will remain the same while navigating throughout the platform (ex: if user set date picker to “last 7 days” in apm and move to logs, date picker will be auto set to “last 7 days” in logs).  
2. Added default metrics (custom dashboards) inside all infrastructure monitoring tabs.
3. Now we are giving K8s events as logs. 
4. Added more metrics and data for K8s monitoring.
