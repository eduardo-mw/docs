## How does usage-based pricing work?

You only pay for the services you use.  All features are included so you don't need to worry about selecting a plan for specific features. 

Pricing depends on the number of hosts in your infrastructure and application and log events.

To know more about usage-based pricing, please see our usage calculation FAQ.

## Infrastructure Monitoring

Every machine/host in your infrastructure is billed at $10. 

A host is any physical or virtual OS instance that you monitor with Middleware. It could be a server, VM, node (in the case of Kubernetes), or App service plan instance (in the case of Azure app services). 

There is no additional cost for containers.

You will be billed with prorated charges for machines that you have installed for the time period that they are in use.

for example, If you have 5 machines for 15 days and 10 machines for the next 15 days, your monthly billing will be $75 .

## APM (Application performance monitoring)

Every host in your application is billed at $20 per month. APM host is the host that is actively generating traces that are submitted to Middleware.

You will be billed with the prorated charges for the host that are in the system for the time period that they are in use.

for example, If you have 5 hosts for 15 days and 3 hosts for the next 15 days, your monthly billing will be $50.

## Log Monitoring

You will be charged $1 for 1M log events .

for example , if you have 3M log events in your account , your monthly billing will be $3.
