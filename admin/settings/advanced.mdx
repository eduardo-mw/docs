The Advanced section is where users can tailor their log tracking infrastructure. The Middleware Host Agent will search for any changes in your account configuration and automatically update the configuration YAML file and reload itself.

Fine-tune your log collection process by selecting your preferred hosts for tracking infrastructure file-based logs, Middleware Agent Logs, and specify custom directory paths for monitoring your log collection.

<Warning> This feature is not available in the Docker Agent since Docker does not allow dynamic volume bindings. </Warning>

# Infrastructure File-Based Logs
Quickly enable OR disable the Middleware Agent from monitoring file-based logs for collection by navigating to Settings, selecting Advanced, and toggling on or off the Infrastructure File-based Logs button.

<Accordion title="Middleware Agent Log Paths">
    You can dynamically select the log files you want to monitor. Add directory paths that you want to monitor for log collection. 

    Below is the accepted regex pattern:
    ```
    '^(\\/(?:[\\w_\\-^* ]+\\/)*(?:[\\w_\\-*]+(?:\\**\\/)?)?[\\w_\\-.]+[^.]$)'
    ```

    The follwing are examples of available paths:
    <Note> ** represents any number of directories </Note>
    ```
    /home/ubuntu/abc.log

    /home/ubuntu/*.log

    /home/ubuntu/**/*.log 
    ```
</Accordion>
