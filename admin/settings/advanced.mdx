## Overview

Advanced setting will allow you to control how your Host agent will be collecting data.

Currently, this feature is only applicable with Linux / Docker Host agent.

## Infrastructure File-Based Logs
This setting can help you enable OR disable log collection from your infrastructure files.

This also consists 2 child settings ...
### 1. Middleware's Agent Logs
This setting can help you enable OR disable log collection, which are generated by Middleware agent itself.

### 2. Middleware's Agent Log Paths
You can dynamically select which different log files you want to monitor.
You can add absolute path to any log file. 

This is the regex pattern that we allow
```
'^(\\/(?:[\\w_\\-^* ]+\\/)*(?:[\\w_\\-*]+(?:\\**\\/)?)?[\\w_\\-.]+[^.]$)'
```

You can add the follwing paths:

`/home/ubuntu/abc.log`

`/home/ubuntu/*.log`

`/home/ubuntu/**/*.log`, where ** represents any number of directories

## How does this work?
The Middleware Host Agent keeps looking if there is any change in your account configuration.
If there is any change, it will automatically update the configuration YAML and reload itself.
