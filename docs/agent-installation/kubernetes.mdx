This guide walks you through installing the MW Agent in a Kubernetes environment. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in the Middleware application. 

The installation will set up a DaemonSet inside your Kubernetes cluster and add necessary components to appropriately permission the DaemonSet pods. A Kubernetes service is also created to allow components to connect to the MW Agent via Cluster IP address & ports (i.e. language-based APMs). 

## Overview
### Prerequisites

-   Kubernetes v1.21 or above
