## What is a Host Agent?
Host Agent is a software component that will run on your infrastructure. 
It will collect metrics and logs from your systems and will send that data to Middleware backend for timeseries storage.

## Benefits of Host Agent based Data collection
1. Granularity and depth: Host agents provide detailed insights into host performance and behavior, collecting metrics at the system and process level.
2. Real-time monitoring: Host agents continuously collect data in real-time, enabling prompt issue detection and proactive problem resolution.
3. Low overhead: Host agents are lightweight, minimizing the impact on system resources while efficiently monitoring performance.
4. Offline operation: Host agents can collect data even without network connectivity, preventing data loss during disruptions.
5. Security and privacy: Host agents operate within the trusted boundaries of host systems, reducing exposure to external risks and enhancing data security.
6. Customizability and extensibility: Host agents offer flexibility for configuration, customization, and integration with other tools and frameworks.
7. Compatibility with legacy systems: Host agents enable data collection from non-standard systems lacking comprehensive APIs or standardized interfaces.
