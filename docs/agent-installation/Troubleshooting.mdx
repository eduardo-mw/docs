If you just installed the Agent, it may take a few moments before you start seeing metrics appear. The first place you should check for metrics is in the unified dashboard.

### If you think you might be experiencing issues, follow this checklist first:

<ol>
   
  <li>Is your host connected to the internet or able to access it through a proxy? 
    <p>Please make sure that the host is connected to the internet and if you are using a proxy, please make sure that it is accessible through a proxy. </p> </li>
  <li>Is there only one Middleware Agent running on your Infrastructure?
       <p>  Please make sure you are not running more than one Middleware agent per infrastructure, it may result in unexpected behavior like data synchronization or duplication of data. </p> </li>
