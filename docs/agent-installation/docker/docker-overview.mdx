<h2>Supported Machines</h2>
<p>We have created docker distributions using https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images</p>
<p>All the OS that supports docker should also support our docker based agent.</p>
<p>This is applicable on both x86 & ARM based machines, as we are using multi-platform builds.</p>

<h2>Current Technical Approach</h2>
<p>In order to collect host level details, our docker agent works on host network mode.</p>
<p>For log reading, the docker agent uses volume binding.</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Current docker installation bash script works well with Linux + Mac machines. We will be making this script adaptable for Windows machines as well.</li>
</ol>
