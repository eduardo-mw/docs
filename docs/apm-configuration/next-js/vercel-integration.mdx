## Overview
Integrating Vercel with Middleware allows you to monitor, analyze, and store traces generated by your Serverless Functions. Additionally, Middleware provides a centralized dashboard where you can view logs, metrics, and traces in one place. Real User Monitoring allows you to monitor performance and understand user behavior, while Synthetics Monitoring enables you to simulate global traffic and measure endpoint uptime.


## Additional Information
Once you set up the integration, traces from your Vercel project will be streamed to Middleware, and you can view all the logs and traces in Middleware's Application Performance Monitoring (APM). Our Vercel dashboard provides summary metrics and access points to drill down into your traces. You can monitor and analyze your Vercel traces along with traces from your infrastructure and applications in Middleware's APM. In Middleware's APM, you can view all the details, including service name, latency, number of requests, success ratio, duration, method name, trace profiling, and attributes. You can also create custom dashboards in Middleware to view the log and trace data that is most important to you and create alerts on different parameters.



## Prerequisites
After this integration, you need to create a project that will be deployed on the Vercel platform. You can refer to this <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no"> link </a> to learn more about Vercel deployment.


## Steps to integrate
To integrate the <a href="https://vercel.com/integrations/middleware" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no" color="blue">Middleware</a>, follow these steps.
<ol>
   
    <li>Go to Vercel’s marketplace, and search for “Middleware”, or go directly to this <a href="https://vercel.com/integrations/middleware/new" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no">link</a>. <img src="/images/agent-installation/vercel-1.png" /> </li>
    <li>Click “Add Integration”. </li>
    <li>From the popup window, select the Vercel account, that you want to connect, and then click “Continue”.  <img src="/images/agent-installation/vercel-2.png" /></li>
     <li>Select the project, which you want to track, so here you can select all of your projects or choose any specific also, then click “Continue”.  <img src="/images/agent-installation/vercel-3.png" />  </li>
     <li>On the next step, the popup will show which of the permission should be granted to track your project. To proceed, click  “Add integration”. <img src="/images/agent-installation/vercel-4.png" /> </li>
      <li>You will be redirected to the Middleware’s Login page, where you can log in with your account so that Vercel will be able to send all the activity to your Middleware’s dashboard.  <img src="/images/agent-installation/vercel-5.png"/></li>
      <li>After logging in, Middleware and Vercel will exchange tokens to establish seamless collaboration, enabling comprehensive activity tracking. Upon completing this final step, you will receive a confirmation message indicating a successful installation. <img src="/images/agent-installation/vercel-6.png" /></li>
      <li>After 3sec, You will be redirected back to the marketplace page with Middleware integrated. </li>
</ol>

## Getting Started with Code
Once you have successfully integrated Middleware, proceed with the following steps to incorporate it into your Vercel project and monitor real-time activity:

1. Install the following package that will help to send all the traces generated from your project. This package will instrument your project based on the OpenTelemetry approach.
<Note>Make sure you have installed the latest version of Next.js or a version greater than 13.2.0, as Vercel introduced their experimental feature in that release.</Note>
<Note>Before proceeding with the Next.js APM setup, make sure you have the **@opentelemetry/api** package installed. If it's not already installed, run the following command: `npm install @opentelemetry/api@">=1.3.0 <1.5.0"`</Note>

```javascript Shell
npm install @middleware.io/agent-apm-nextjs
```

2. As this feature is experimental, modify your next.config.js where you need to explicitly opt-in by enabling the instrumentation hook as true. Check the following code for a better idea:

```javascript Shell
const nextConfig = {
     ---
     ---
     experimental: {
         instrumentationHook: true
     }
     ---
     ---
}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

3. Create a custom `instrumentation.ts` file in your project root directory, and add the following code:

```javascript Shell
// @ts-ignore
import tracker from '@middleware.io/agent-apm-nextjs';

export function register() {
    tracker.track({
        projectName: "<PROJECT-NAME>",
        serviceName: "<SERVICE-NAME>",
        accountKey: "<ACCOUNT-KEY>",
        target: "vercel",
    });
}
```
<Note>You can find your &lt;ACCOUNT-KEY&gt; on the Installation screen for <a href="https://app.middleware.io/installation#apm/nextjs" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no" color="blue">NextJs / Vercel</a>.</Note>

4. To enable logging in your project, add the following code in your file:
```javascript
// @ts-ignore
import tracker from '@middleware.io/agent-apm-nextjs';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
    // ...
    // Your existing code

    tracker.info("Info Sample");
    tracker.warn("Warn Sample", {
        "tester": "Alex",
    });
    tracker.debug("Debug Sample");
    tracker.error("Error Sample");

    // ...
    // Your existing code
}
```
5. Now deploy your project to vercel platform.

<Note>For additional information and in-depth guidance, you can clone the sample project from the [GitHub](https://github.com/middleware-labs/demo-apm/tree/master/nextjs/setup) repository to explore further.</Note>

<Note>Make sure you have set up the <a href="https://vercel.com/integrations/middleware" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no" color="blue"> Middleware </a> integration and enabled traces before deploying your project. Otherwise, you will need to perform a <strong>project redeployment</strong> in order to activate and utilize traces.</Note>

## Visualize Your Data
Once you have set up the integration between Vercel and Middleware, you can visualize your data in Middleware's dashboard. The dashboard provides an overview of your Vercel project's performance and allows you to drill down into your traces and logs.
<img src="/images/agent-installation/vercel-7.png" />

You can view your traces in the dedicated Traces screen, which shows you detailed information about each trace, including service name, latency, number of requests, success ratio, duration, method name, trace profiling, and attributes. In addition to the Traces screen, you can also view your Vercel traces along with traces from your infrastructure and applications in Middleware's Application Performance Monitoring (APM).

For logs, Middleware provides a dedicated screen where you can see all the logs generated from your project. You can filter the logs based on service name, log level, attributes and time.

## Troubleshoot
If you have integrated Middleware and are still not getting your traces, try redeploying your project. This should ensure that the traces are properly generated and collected by Middleware. 

If you still encounter issues, please refer to the Middleware documentation or reach out to out support team for assistance.


## Conclusion
Integrating Vercel with Middleware allows you to monitor and analyze traces generated by your serverless functions in a unified dashboard, along with logs and other data. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily set up the integration and start tracking your project’s raw activity on a live basis.

With Middleware's real user monitoring and synthetics monitoring capabilities, you can gain valuable insights into user behavior and endpoint uptime. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, reach out to Middleware's support team for assistance.
