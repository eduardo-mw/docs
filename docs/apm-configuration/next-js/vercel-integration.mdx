## Overview
Integrating Vercel with Middleware allows you to monitor, analyze, and store traces generated by your Serverless Functions. Additionally, Middleware provides a centralized dashboard where you can view logs, metrics, traces, and profiling data all in one place. Real User Monitoring allows you to monitor performance and understand user behavior. Profiling, on the other hand, enables you to capture detailed performance data and gain deeper insights into the behavior of your applications. Lastly, Synthetics Monitoring allows you to simulate global traffic and measure endpoint uptime.

This comprehensive set of features empowers you to proactively manage and optimize the performance of your applications on Vercel with ease.


## Additional Information
Once you set up the integration, traces from your Vercel project will be streamed to Middleware, and you can view all the logs, and profiling information in Middleware's Application Performance Monitoring (APM) dashboard. Our Vercel dashboard provides summary metrics and access points to drill down into your traces. You can monitor and analyze your Vercel traces along with traces from your infrastructure and applications in Middleware's APM.

In Middleware's APM, you can view all the details, including service name, latency, number of requests, success ratio, duration, method name, trace profiling, and attributes. This allows you to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your applications for better user experience.

You can also create custom dashboards in Middleware to view the log, trace and profiling data that is most important to you and create alerts on different parameters. This helps you stay on top of critical issues and respond to them proactively.



## Prerequisites
After this integration, you need to create a project that will be deployed on the Vercel platform. You can refer to this <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no"> link </a> to learn more about Vercel deployment.

      <li>After 3sec, You will be redirected back to the marketplace page with Middleware integrated. </li>
</ol>

## Essential Considerations
<ul>
    <li>The instrumentation file must be located at the root of your project, not inside the `app` or `pages` directory.</li>
    <li>In case you're using the `src` folder, please ensure that the instrumentation file is placed within the `src` directory, alongside the `pages` and `app` directories.</li>
    <li>If you use the `pagesExtension` <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/pageExtensions" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no" color="blue"> config option </a> to add a suffix, it is essential to synchronize the instrumentation filename accordingly. For example, if you use `pagesExtension: ['ts']`, the instrumentation file should be named `instrumentation.ts`.</li>
    <li>When you don't have any APIs (or Serverless functions) integrated, the Vercel platform will treat the app as a static website during deployment. Consequently, in this scenario, the `instrumentation.ts` file will not be invoked, resulting in the absence of traces or logs in your Middleware account.</li>
</ul>
<Note>You can read detailed prerequisites and essential information about OpenTelemetry in <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no" color="blue">Vercel's documentation</a>. This will be helpful for you in seamlessly integrating it into your project.</Note>

## Getting Started with Code
Once you have successfully integrated Middleware, proceed with the following steps to incorporate it into your Vercel project and monitor real-time activity:

1. Install the following package that will help to send all the traces and profiling data generated from your project. This package will instrument your project based on the OpenTelemetry approach.
<Note>Make sure you have installed the latest version of Next.js or a version greater than 13.4+, as Vercel introduced their experimental feature in that release.</Note>
<Note>Before proceeding with the Next.js APM setup, make sure you have the **@opentelemetry/api** package installed. If it's not already installed, run the following command: `npm install @opentelemetry/api@">=1.3.0 <1.5.0"`</Note>

```
npm install @middleware.io/agent-apm-nextjs
```

2. As this feature is experimental, modify your `next.config.js` where you need to explicitly opt-in by enabling the instrumentation hook as true. Check the following code for a better idea:

```javascript Shell
const nextConfig = {
    // ...
    // Your existing config

     experimental: {
         instrumentationHook: true
     }

    // ...
    // Your existing config
}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

3. Create a custom `instrumentation.ts` (or `.js`) file in your project <strong>root</strong> directory (or inside `src` folder, if using one), and add the following code:

```javascript Shell
// @ts-ignore
import tracker from '@middleware.io/agent-apm-nextjs';

export function register() {
    tracker.track({
        projectName: "<PROJECT-NAME>",
        serviceName: "<SERVICE-NAME>",
        accessToken: "<ACCESS-TOKEN>",
        target: "vercel"
    });
}
```
<Note>You can find your &lt;ACCESS-TOKEN&gt; on the Installation screen for <a href="https://app.middleware.io/installation#apm/nextjs" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no" color="blue">NextJs / Vercel</a>.</Note>

4. To enable logging in your project, add the following code in your file:
```javascript
// @ts-ignore
import tracker from '@middleware.io/agent-apm-nextjs';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
    // ...
    // Your existing code

    tracker.info("Info Sample");
    tracker.warn("Warn Sample", {
        "tester": "Alex"
    });
    tracker.debug("Debug Sample");
    tracker.error("Error Sample");

    // ...
    // Your existing code
}
```
5. Now deploy your project to vercel platform.

<Note>For additional information and in-depth guidance, you can clone the sample project from the [GitHub](https://github.com/middleware-labs/demo-apm/tree/master/nextjs/setup) repository to explore further.</Note>

<Note>Make sure you have set up the <a href="https://vercel.com/integrations/middleware" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no" color="blue"> Middleware </a> integration and enabled traces before deploying your project. Otherwise, you will need to perform a <strong>project redeployment</strong> in order to activate and utilize traces.</Note>

## Visualize Your Data
Once you have set up the integration between Vercel and Middleware, you can visualize your data in Middleware's dashboard. The dashboard provides an overview of your Vercel project's performance and allows you to drill down into your traces, logs, and profiling data.
<img src="/images/agent-installation/vercel-7.png" />

#### Traces
You can view your Traces in the dedicated Traces screen, which shows you detailed information about each trace, including service name, latency, number of requests, success ratio, duration, method name, trace profiling, and attributes. In addition to the Traces screen, you can also view your Vercel traces along with traces from your infrastructure and applications in Middleware's Application Performance Monitoring (APM).
<img src="/images/agent-installation/vercel-8.png" />

#### Logs
For logs, Middleware provides a dedicated screen where you can see all the logs generated from your project. You can filter the logs based on service name, log level, attributes, and time.
<img src="/images/agent-installation/vercel-9.png" />

#### Profiling
Profiling is like having a detailed stopwatch that measures the time taken for each part of your app to do its job. This information is then shown in a visual graph, highlighting the areas that may be slowing down your app. By using this data, you can find and fix those slow parts, making your app faster and smoother for users to enjoy. It's like finding and improving the sluggish spots in your app to make it run better overall.

With precise timing for each operation, Profiling offers a powerful tool to enhance application efficiency and deliver an exceptional user experience.

## Troubleshoot
If you have integrated Middleware and are still not getting your traces and profiling data, try redeploying your project. This should ensure that the traces and profiling data are properly generated and collected by Middleware.

If you still encounter issues, please refer to the Middleware documentation or reach out to out support team for assistance.


## Conclusion
Integrating Vercel with Middleware allows you to monitor and analyze traces and profiling data generated by your serverless functions in a unified dashboard, along with logs and other data. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily set up the integration and start tracking your project’s raw activity on a live basis.

With Middleware's real user monitoring and synthetics monitoring capabilities, you can gain valuable insights into user behavior and endpoint uptime. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, reach out to Middleware's support team for assistance.
