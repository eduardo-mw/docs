This guide provides an overview of Middleware Application Performance Monitoring and instructions for its configuration on applications using Node.js, Go, Python, Java, PHP, .NET, Cloudflare, or Next.js. 


## Overview
Middleware Application Performance Monitoring (APM) provides deep visibility into your applications by unifying application-level logs, metrics, and traces with data and logs from the host agent in out-of-the-box dashboards and detailed drill-down views. 


Middleware APM does require our Middleware Host Agent (MW Agent) be installed on the applicationâ€™s host infrastructure. If you do not have the MW Agent installed please see our installation guides for Kubernetes, Linux, or Docker. On Windows platforms only Go, Node, Python, and Java are currently supported. 


To view or setup demos and example use cases please see our <a href="https://github.com/middleware-labs/demo-apm"> APM Demo Github repository </a>.
