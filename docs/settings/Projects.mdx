## Overview

Projects allow you to easily separate your Observability stack between multiple cloud architectures and applications. They do so by separating modules (Dashboard, Infrastructure Monitoring, APM, Logs, RUM, Synthetic Monitoring, Recommendations) into isolated and controlled environments.

## Limitations

### Usage Dashboard

The [Usage Dashboard](https://docs.middleware.io/docs/settings/billing-&-usages#usages) shows data across all Projects and is visible to all Middleware Admins. You can choose to view all Projects usage at once, or per Project.

### Plans & Billing

Middleware supports one Credit Card shared for the entire Account, and will bill according to aggregate usage across all Projects. 

### Users

Users have access to all Projects for the time being. We will implement per Project user access eventually.

## Step 1: Create New Project:

## Step 2: Enter Project Details

    <Note> The name of your Alias will be the default subdomain (e.g., the subdomain & URL of the below account will be dev-env.middleware.io). Subdomains must be unique across all Middleware Accounts and are adjustable at any time.</Note>

## Step 4: Installing Project Modules:

You must install the specific modules for your new Project. See the related [Quickstart](https://docs.middleware.io/quickstart) guides to get going.

<Warning> Do not run more than one Middleware agent per machine. Multiple agents will cause unexpected behavior. </Warning>
