## How does usage-based pricing work?
With our Pay-as-you-go pricing mode, you pay only for what you use. Your monthly billing amount depends on number of hosts, machines, and log events.

### Infrastructure Monitoring
Every machine/host in your infrastructure is billed at $10 per month. A host is any physical or virtual OS instance that you monitor with Middleware. It could be a server, VM, node (in the case of Kubernetes), or App service plan instance (in the case of Azure app services).
There is no additional cost for containers.
You will be billed with prorated charges for machines that you have installed for the time period that they are in use.
for example, If you have 5 machines for 15 days and 10 machines for the next 15 days, your monthly billing will be $75 .

### APM (Application performance monitoring)
Every host in your application is billed at $20 per month. APM host is the host that is actively generating traces that are submitted to Middleware.
You will be billed with the prorated charges for the host that are in the system for the time period that they are in use.
for example, If you have 5 hosts for 15 days and 3 hosts for the next 15 days, your monthly billing will be $50.

### Log Monitoring
You will be charged $1 for 1M log events .
for example , if you have 3M log events in your account , your monthly billing will be $3.
