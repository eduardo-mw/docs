## Can I use Middleware to monitor Azure services ?
1. Our Linux agent can be used across almost all cloud platforms including [Azure VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/virtual-machines/linux/).
2. Our K8s helm chart can be used across for managed k8s services. including [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/kubernetes-service).

Azure specific integrations are also on the roadmap, We also welcome requests for specific integrations.

{/* We are also working on Cloud specific integrations for collecting cloud specific information.
In this category, we have started with AWS, but we will continue to add more cloud platforms in the future, on request basis. */}

{/* ## Which cloud platforms can be monitored by Middleware ?
Many of our services are cloud-agnostic
For Example,
1. Our Linux agent can be used across almost all cloud platforms. i.e. AWS EC2, Azure VM, GCP machines, Digitalocean Droplets, etc.
2. Our K8s helm chart can be used across many managed services. i.e. AWS EKS, AKS, GKE, Digitalocean Kubernetes, etc.
