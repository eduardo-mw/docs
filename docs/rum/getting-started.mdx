## Overview
Middleware Real User Monitoring (RUM) provides insights into your application or website through detailed data on user interactions and frontend performance. With real-time data on page load times, errors, and more you can quickly identify and resolve performance issues to improve user experience and engagement. Check out the video below for more information.

## Prerequisites
JavaScript-based web application (mobile apps not currently supported)

## Install
This guide walks you through setting up Real User Monitoring (RUM) with JavaScript. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in your Middleware Account.

### Step 1: Import Javascript CDN
Add the following script tag to the head section of your index.html file.
```javascript
<script src="https://cdnjs.middleware.io/browser/libs/0.0.1/middleware-rum.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
## Step 2: Initialize the SDK
Add the following lines in your index.html file below the script tag entered in Step 1. We recommend copying directly from the Installation page; select the appropriate Application from the list and copy the code snippet in Step 2. The window.Middleware attribute is set in the middleware-rum.min.js script from Step 1. In the example below, env and recording are optional. Recording set to 1 is the default value and records the entire user session. To track only browser traces and errors set recording to 0.

```javascript
<script>
    if (window.Middleware){
        Middleware.track({
            serviceName: "service_name",
            projectName: "project_name",
            accountKey: "account_key",
            target:"https://<UID>.middleware.io",
            env: “production”,
            recording: “1”
        })
    }
</script>
```

### Step 3: Add User Information [optional]
To gather user details add key-value pairs, as shown below. Any user metadata can be defined as a key-value pair.


```javascript

if(window.Middleware){
...
  defaultAttributes: { 
      name: 'John Doe', 
      email: 'john@email.com', 
      user_type: 'admin', // it can be key value pairs
  }
}
```

Once RUM is configured, metrics should begin appearing on the RUM Dashboard in Middleware within a few minutes. For more information on the RUM Dashboards see <a href="https://docs.middleware.io/docs/rum/rum-middleware"> here </a>. 

For any issues please reach out to our team in your Slack channel or through the help menu in your <a href="https://app.middleware.io/auth/register"> Middleware Account </a>.
