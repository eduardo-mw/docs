Real User Monitoring (RUM) is a technique used to collect performance and usage data directly from end-users' browsers or devices. It provides insights into the actual user experience by tracking metrics such as page load times, user interactions, errors, and more. RUM helps organizations understand how their websites or applications perform in real-world conditions, allowing them to identify and address performance issues and improve overall user satisfaction.

Benefits of RUM
---------------
* **Accurate User Experience Insights:** RUM provides real-time data on how users interact with your website or app, giving you a clear picture of their experience.
* **Performance Optimization:** By identifying bottlenecks and performance issues, RUM enables you to optimize your site or app for better user engagement.
* **Business Impact Analysis:** RUM data helps correlate user experience with business metrics, such as conversion rates, bounce rates, and revenue.
* **Issue Prioritization:** With RUM, you can prioritize and fix critical issues that impact a large number of users, ensuring a positive experience for your audience.
* **Competitive Advantage:** RUM allows you to benchmark your performance against competitors and industry standards.

Key Metrics Tracked by RUM
--------------------------
RUM tracks various performance metrics that provide insights into user experience. Some essential metrics include:

* **Page Load Time:** The time it takes for a page to load completely in a user's browser.
* **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** The time when the first content appears on the screen.
* **First Input Delay (FID):** The time between the first user interaction and the browser's response.
* **Error Rates:** The frequency and types of errors encountered by users.
* **User Interactions:** Tracking user actions such as clicks, form submissions, and interactions with UI elements.
