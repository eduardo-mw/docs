<p>AWS [Metric Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables real-time streaming of AWS CloudWatch metrics.<br/><br/>Configure CloudWatch using the AWS Console : </p>

## Create a new Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream

<ol>
<li>Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Kinesis console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis).</li>
<li>Choose <b>Data Firehose</b> in the navigation panel.</li>
<li>Choose <b>Create delivery stream</b>.</li>
<li>
The stream’s Source should be <b>Direct PUT</b> and Destination set to <b>HTTP Endpoint</b> with the following details:<br/>
<b>Kinesis endpoint:</b> https://`{ACCOUNT-UID}`.middleware.io/v1/metrics/cloudwatch<br/>
<b>Access key :</b> Enter your Middleware API key.
</li>
<li>In the Backup settings, select an S3 backup bucket to receive any failed events that exceed the retry duration.</li>
</ol>

<Info>Replace `{ACCOUNT-UID}` with the text in the URL (ex URL is "s05zpimz.middleware.io" , here s05zpimz is `{ACCOUNT-UID}`.)</Info>

## Create a new CloudWatch Metric Stream

## Visualize Your Metrics

Once you have completed the setup mentioned above, you can visualize your data in the 2 difefrent ways.

### 1. Middleware's Default AWS Dashboards

<p>We have created default dashboards for all the popular AWS services.</p>
<p>Each dashboard consists a good amount of graphs representing all the important metrics for that particular namespace.</p>

Here is one sample dashboard for EC2 namespace.

You can refer all similar dashboards relevant to AWS over [here](https://app.middleware.io/reports?search=AWS)

### 2. Build Custom Widgets using Middleware's Dashboard Builder

<p>You can create a dashboard from scratch by yourself.</p>
<p>If you add a new widget to any existing dashboard, you will be able to see list of available AWS metrics under the "cloud" Data source.</p>
<p>You can visualize in many different Widget types i.e. Timeseries, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, etc.</p>
