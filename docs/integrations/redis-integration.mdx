title: "Redis Integration"
---
Retrieve data and metrics from a Redis instance to effectively monitor the performance of the Redis server.

## Prerequisites
Before using this integration, ensure that the Middleware Host agent has been successfully installed on your machine.

## Setup
Follow these steps to set up the Redis integration:
1. Create a YAML file on your system containing the database collection details, as shown below:

Ex. `/home/ubuntu/redis-creds.yaml`
```
redis:
  endpoint: localhost:7379
  password: redis
```

<Note>Optional settings include:<br />- `password`: if your Redis server requires authentication.<br />- `transport` (default = `tcp`): Type of network, to access the server. Options: `tcp` and `Unix`.<br />- `tls`:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `insecure` (default = true): To switch client transport security for the connection.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `ca_file`: Path to the CA certificate file.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `cert_file`: Path to the TLS certificate file.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `key_file`: Path to the TLS key file.</Note>

<Note><strong>For Docker Agent Users</strong>: If you are running the Middleware Docker agent, then we recommend to keep the creds YAML under `/var/log` directory. This is because, the Docker agent might not support dynamic volume binding.</Note>

2. In the Middleware Store, enable the Redis Integration, select a host, and provide the YAML file path created in step 1.

## Visualize Analytics
Redis analytics can be visualized in two ways:

### 1. Middleware's Default Redis Dashboard
After setting up the Redis Integration, you will gain access to various analytics in the default Redis Dashboard.

### 2. Create your own dashboard
<p>You have the flexibility to create your own dashboard from scratch.</p>
<p>When adding a new widget to an existing dashboard, you will find a list of available Redis metrics under the "redis" data source.</p>
<p>These metrics can be visualized using various widget types, such as Timeseries, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, and more.</p>

## Metrics collected
Below is a list of Redis metrics that this integration will collect:
