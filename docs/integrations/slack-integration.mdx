### Prerequisites
1.  Slack account with admin access.
2.  Middleware account with access to the integration section.

2.  Clicking on slack will redirect you to slack login page.
3.  You will be redirected to the Slack integration page. Here, you need to allow the alert module to access your Slack account and channel list. This will enable the module to send notifications to the appropriate channel(s).
4.  After authorization, slack gets connected to your Middleware account.

### Configure alerts on slack channel

1.  Navigate to alerts from the left menu.
2.  Alerts -> Rules -> create new ->Notify your team\
