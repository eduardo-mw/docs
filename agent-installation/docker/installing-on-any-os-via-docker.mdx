## Prerequisites


<ol>
    <li>Create a [Middleware account](https://app.middleware.io/auth/register) </li>
    <li>Keep logging into your account  </li>
    <li>If you are a Windows user, please make sure Bash and curl tools are installed in your system. </li>
</ol>
## Use our one-step easy installation

<p>To proceed with the agent installation, make sure you have docker installed and running on your system. You can install docker for <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/">windows</a> or <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/" >macOS</a> or <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">Ubuntu</a>. </p>

<p>To install an agent on a host, copy the  Installation command and paste it into the command prompt. Your command will look like the following example, and it will include your API key, so you won't need to create one.</p>





```bash
MW_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx TARGET=https://uid.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/docker-install.sh)"
```

<p>If you are using a Windows system, you can configure the ENV variables as follows.</p>

```bash
MW_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxx TARGET=https://uid.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/docker-install.sh)"
```
<Info>Replace the MW_API_KEY value with your API key or directly copy the full command with the API key from the <a href="https://app.middleware.io/auth/login" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no">installation menu.</a></Info>
<Info>Replace "uid" with the text in the URL (ex URL is "s05zpimz.middleware.io" , here s05zpimz is uid.)</Info>

## Adding Tags to your host

If you want to add tags to your host, you can do it by adding `MW_HOST_TAGS` environment variable to your installation command.


```bash
MW_HOST_TAGS=key1:value1,key2:value2,... MW_API_KEY= ....
```

MW_HOST_TAGS can be comma seperated key value pairs as shown above

### Special Tags

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| name | "name" tag will be considered as an alias for the host.

## Verify the status of agent
<p>Run the agentâ€™s status command to verify the installation.</p>


```javascript Shell
docker ps -a --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/middleware-labs/agent-host-go:master
```

<p>A successful installation returns the status UP or Exited and in case of unsuccessful installation, the status will be blank. </p>

```javascript Shell
docker stop `docker ps -a -q --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/middleware-labs/agent-host-go:master`
```

```javascript Shell
docker rm `docker ps -a -q --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/middleware-labs/agent-host-go:master`
