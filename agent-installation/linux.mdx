This guide walks you through installing the MW Agent on a Linux machine. These instructions can also be found on the Installation page in the Middleware application. 

We offer two install scripts based on your operating system. Please note that not all Linux machines are supported. A list of supported machines can be found under Prerequisites.

# Install

### Step 1: Access Linux Installation

Log in to Middleware, navigate to the Installation Page in the bottom left corner and select Linux-Based from the Infrastructure section

![DEB Linux install](/images/agent-installation/k3.jpg)

### Step 2: Run Linux Install Command

Copy the appropriate installation command based on your machine’s operating system. Copying the command directly from the Installation page ensures your API key and UID are inserted accurately.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="DEB">

    `DEB`: Compatible with Debian or Debian-based operating systems. For AWS instances this includes Ubuntu and Debian.

    ```bash Shell
    MW_API_KEY=<xxxxxxxxxx> MW_TARGET=https://<uid>.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/deb-install.sh)"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="RPM">

    `RPM`: Compatible with Red Hat Package Manager and operating systems like Red Hat or CentOS. Use this for AWS instances using Amazon Linux. 
    
    ```bash Shell
    MW_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxx MW_TARGET=https://<uid>.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl https://install.middleware.io/scripts/rpm-install.sh)"
    ```          
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Step 3: Add Tags to Installation [Optional]

Add tags with the `MW_HOST_TAGS` environment variable to the installation command. Include any desired tags as comma-separated key-value pairs, as shown below. Use the tag `name` to create an alias for the host (e.g. production). 

```bash Shell
MW_HOST_TAGS=<key1>:<value1>,<key2>:<value2>,… MW_API_KEY=…
```


### Step 4: Verify Installation

Run the following command to verify the MW Agent status:

```bash Shell
sudo systemctl status mwservice
```
A successful installation will return the following Agent Status report:

# Troubleshooting

<Warning>  Run only one MW Agent per node per host. Multiple agents will cause unexpected behavior.</Warning>

Once the MW Agent is installed metrics should begin appearing in the Middleware application within a few minutes. If metrics do not appear, confirm that the machine has access to the internet, either directly or through a proxy, and that only one MW Agent is running per node. 

For any issues please reach out to our team in your Slack channel or through the help menu in the Middleware Application.


# Uninstall
To uninstall the MW agent, use one of the following commands:

    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="RPM">
