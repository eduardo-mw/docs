description: "A couple steps towards monitoring your infrastructure"
---

Our Kubernetes Auto-Instrumentation script is designed to help you install the Middleware Agent in a few simple steps. The script is accessible through the <b>Installation</b> option found in the bottom of the nav bar. Once the agent is installed it will monitor your Kubernetes cluster and collect distributed traces for all applications running inside the cluster.

## How Auto-Instrumentation Works
<p>The Kubernetes Auto-Instrumentation script will install a helm chart in the cluster which will...</p>
<ol>
    <li>Detect supported programming languages for all the pods running inside your cluster (refer to the Language Support section below)</li>
    <li>Install Opentelemetry auto-instrumentation libraries in all of the pods selected</li>
    <li>Install a Daemonset to monitor the performance of all K8s components (nodes, pods, containers, etc.)</li>
    <li>Send all infrastructure + application data to Middleware's backend</li>
</ol>
