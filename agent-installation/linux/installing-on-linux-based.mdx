## Prerequisites


<ol>
    <li>Create a <a href="https://app.middleware.io/auth/register/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no">Middleware account</a></li>
    <li>Keep logging into your account  </li>
</ol>
## Use our one-step easy installation 
<p>To install a Middleware agent on a host, copy the Installation command and paste it into the command prompt. Your command will look like the following example, and it will include your API key.</p>

<p>For DEB (Debian Packages : Compatible for Debian and derivative operating systems)</p>

```bash
MW_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx TARGET=https://uid.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/deb-install.sh)"
```

<p>For RPM (Package supported by RedHat Package Manager, Compatible for systems like RedHat/CentOS etc.)</p>

```bash
MW_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx TARGET=https:/uid.middleware.io:443 bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.middleware.io/scripts/rpm-install.sh)"
```
<Info>Replace the MW_API_KEY value with your API key or directly copy the full command with the API key from the <a href="https://app.middleware.io/auth/login" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" translate="no">installation menu.</a></Info>
<Info>Replace "uid" with the text in the URL (ex URL is "s05zpimz.middleware.io" , here s05zpimz is uid.)</Info>

## Adding Tags to your host 

If you want to add tags to your host, you can do it by adding `MW_HOST_TAGS` environment variable to your installation command.


```bash
MW_HOST_TAGS=key1:value1,key2:value2
```

MW_HOST_TAGS can be comma seperated key value pairs as shown above

### Special Tags

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| name | "name" tag will be considered as an alias for the host.

## Verify the status of agent
<p>Run the agentâ€™s status command to verify the installation.</p>


```javascript Shell
sudo systemctl status mwservice
```
